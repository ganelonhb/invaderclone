- Asteroids come down from the top of the screen (like bullets)
- Chance of asteroid is determined by difficulty_mod
- Asteroid is rendered beneath the enemies (in case the theme wants to make it look like it's on the ground)

- Allow modification of things like bullet speed, starting lives, splash text, etc

- name input scene

- GUI theme creator???
